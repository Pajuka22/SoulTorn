Note from Emily to whoever ends up making the levels:

- Each level scene has to be in the right difficulty folder and in build settings
- You can name the level scenes whatever you want as long as names are unique (eg. you don't have to say Level #1, #2, etc or smth)
- If they aren't ordered logically in build settings, the code won't (shouldn't) break, but I won't like it
- Each level scene needs all the stuff in Test Level A and probably other stuff too

Yeet have fun
